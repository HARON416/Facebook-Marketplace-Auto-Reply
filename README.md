# ðŸ¤– Facebook Marketplace AutoReply

Tired of manually replying to messages like:

- "Is this still available?"
- "I'm interested in this item"
- ...and other common first-time buyer messages?

This tool automatically replies to first-time messages using your default reply, so you can focus on closing sales.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Clone this repo or [download the executable](https://www.mediafire.com/file/rk1rh0s81wmvbou/FB-AutoReply.exe/file)
2. Run the program:
   - Using Go: `go run main.go`
   - Or double-click the downloaded executable
3. Enter your default reply message when prompted
4. The bot will open a Facebook login page â€” log in with your username and password
5. Enter your Messages PIN in the popup modal to restore chats
6. Sit back and watch it auto-reply to new and unreplied messages from potential buyers
